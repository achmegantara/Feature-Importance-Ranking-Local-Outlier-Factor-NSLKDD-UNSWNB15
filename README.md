### Abstract
<h4 align="Justify">
The successfulness of the machine learning process for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is determined by the quality of the model generated from training data process. Good training data can be obtained by performing pre-processing data in the dataset, such as feature extraction, feature reduction and feature transformation. However, the method used for specify what selected features become main problem in IDS research topic. A good feature selection process will affect IDS performance and computational time needed for detecting some intrusion. In this research, we work on that problem by developing a new feature selection and data reduction approach by combining Feature Importance Ranking method with Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Feature Importan Ranking method is used to calculate the importance value of each feature or attribute in the dataset and LOF is used to detect the outlier data in the dataset and remove it. After pre-processing step is passed, classification process will be carried out to test the training data. By using this method, it is expected to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values, reduce the false alarm rate of the IDS system and to reduce the computation time of the program, so the proposed method can be used to increase the performance of the IDS.
